The teacher program is deigned to be a program that is used by a teacher or administrator to keep up with their class.
Functions included allow the teacher to set a username and password and requires a log in at the beginning
Once the user is logged in with their newly set credentials, they will have access to a number of functions.
The classroom functions included allow the teacher to add students to their class and assign grades to those students.
Once a class is set and students and grades assigned the program will return the grades of the class as well as the highest
and lowest grade in the class.
The teacher (user) will also be able to search for a specific student by name. 
The teacher will also have access to a function that will show the grade required to recieve and A,B,C, etc. with ranges 
that will be fairly simple to alter

In order to get started with this program, simply start the program and follow the on screen prompts
